Some notes: 

- I used MVVM as I feel it's a really nice architecture for iOS applications that ables the developer to test as much as possible all layers. 
- All Static strings are hardcoded, on a Professional project should be localized, I'm used to using and String + Extension for that. 
- I added tests on all layers that can be tested, as I'm used to.
